# Cover Letter Generator

## What is it?

### This is a website that aims to help making cover letters easier. This will help streamline the job application process, and make the process of making cover letters for a job posting significantly easier by tailoring a cover letter with an inputted resume and cover letter.

## What was it built with?

### This website was built with Tailwind + Node.js

## How does it work?
### It sends an inputted job description and resume to OpenAI's Davinci text generation model and outputs a tailored cover letter for a user. If you are using the website right now, make sure to compile it locally, and use npm install openai.

## What's coming next?
### Ideally, the ability to input pdf and text files as well as stronger cover letters. Hopefully, a chrome extension with different functionality but sharing a majority of the same code. Once that functionality is added, I will host the website on GitHub pages make sure the user will not have to provide their own API Key to use the website.
